### Abstract

Recent years have seen rapid progress in meta-learning methods, which transfer knowledge across tasks and domains to efficiently learn new tasks, optimize the learning process itself, and even generate new learning methods from scratch. Meta-learning can be seen as the logical conclusion of the arc that machine learning has undergone in the last decade, from learning classifiers, to learning representations, and finally to learning algorithms that themselves acquire representations, classifiers, and policies for acting in environments. In practice, meta-learning has been shown to yield new state-of-the-art automated machine learning methods, novel deep learning architectures, and substantially improved one-shot learning systems. Moreover, to improve one’s own learning capabilities through experience can also be viewed as a hallmark of intelligent beings, and neuroscience shows a strong connection between human and reward learning and the growing sub-field of meta-reinforcement learning. 

Some of the fundamental questions that this workshop aims to address are:

- How can we exploit our domain knowledge to effectively guide the meta-learning process and make it more efficient? • What are the meta-learning processes in nature (e.g., in humans), and how can we take inspiration from them?
- Which machine learning approaches are best suited for meta-learning, in which circumstances, and why?
- What principles can we learn from meta-learning to help us design the next generation of learning systems?

**In this year’s edition of the workshop, we propose the workshop to have the following four foci**, which are informed by recent developments in meta-learning:

- Are there broadly applicable desiderata for meta-learning algorithms (e.g., modularity, interpretability), or is this more a function of the application domain?
- Can we derive entirely new and generally applicable machine learning components (e.g., architectural blocks, learning rate schedules, optimizers, task sets) by meta-learning and can they transfer to very different tasks?
- Can we derive prescriptions for algorithm design by looking at properties of meta-learned systems?
- What is unique and common amongst various meta-learning settings, including few-shot learning, architecture search, hyperparameter optimization, etc.?

As prospective participants, we primarily target machine learning researchers interested in the questions and foci outlined above. Specific target communities within machine learning include, but are not limited to: meta-learning, AutoML, reinforcement learning, deep learning, optimization, evolutionary computation, and Bayesian optimization. We also invite submissions from researchers who study human learning and neuroscience, to provide a broad and interdisciplinary perspective to the attendees.

## Submission Instructions

### Important Dates

- Submission deadline: [September 17th, 2021, 11:59 PM AoE](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=MetaLearn%40NeurIPS+2021+Submission+Deadline&iso=20210917T2359&p1=3926)
- Notification: October 15th, 2021
- Video recording to SlidesLive: TBA
- Camera-ready submission (paper + poster) to OpenReview: TBA
- Workshop: TBA

### Formatting

We have provided a modified `.sty` file [here](neurips_2021.sty) that appropriately lists the name of the workshop when `\neuripsfinal` is enabled. Please use this style files in conjunction with corresponding LaTeX `.tex` template from the [NeurIPS website](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/StyleFiles) to submit a final camera-ready copy. Both the submission and the camera-ready can be up to <b>8 pages</b>, but there is no penalty for a shorter paper (e.g., the usual 4-page workshop paper).

Accepted papers and supplementary material will be made available on the workshop website. However, these do not constitute archival publications and no formal workshop proceedings will be made available, meaning contributors are free to publish their work in archival journals or conferences.

### FAQ

1. Can supplementary material be added beyond the 8-page limit for submissions, and are there any restrictions on it?

   Yes, you may include additional supplementary material, but you should ensure that the main paper is self-contained, since looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers. The supplementary material should also follow the same NeurIPS format as the paper and be limited to a reasonable amount (max 10 pages in addition to the main submission).

1. Can a submission to this workshop be submitted to another NeurIPS workshop in parallel?

   We discourage this, as it leads to more work for reviewers across multiple workshops. Our suggestion is to pick one workshop to submit to.

1. Can a paper be submitted to the workshop that has already appeared at a previous conference with published proceedings?

   We won't be accepting such submissions unless they have been adapted to contain significantly new results (where novelty is one of the qualities reviewers will be asked to evaluate).

1. Can a paper be submitted to the workshop that is currently under review or will be under review at a conference during the review phase?

   From our side, it is perfectly fine to submit a condensed version of a parallel conference submission if it also fine for the conference in question. Our workshop does not have archival proceedings, and therefore parallel submissions of extended versions to other conferences are acceptable.

## Review Process

### Reviewing Mentorship

This year we are trialing a new reviewer mentorship scheme, which we hope will improve the future pool of expert reviewers in machine learning. Junior reviewers will be able to provide reviews in a guided setting and will be linked with senior reviewers who will give them feedback and advice throughout the reviewing process. It is our hope that this will be a useful learning experience for reviewers and improve the overall quality of reviewing.

In order for this to be feasible, all submissions will be asked to provide **two** contacts who have agreed to review for the workshop. These volunteers can, of course, be authors of the submission, or people who have agreed to review on behalf of the authors. Depending on their experience reviewing, these contacts will be assigned to either a junior or senior reviewer role. All submissions will be ensured at least one senior reviewer, since we will still be directly recruiting for reviewers as in previous years.

If you would like to sign up, or recommend somebody, to be either a junior or senior reviewer, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSebBTVLq-IRwxsP857MmmTwtTBwyRamghnNLp71I9vr1q6-Jg/viewform?usp=sf_link) by 2 October 2021.
